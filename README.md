### App Description:
   
    The app will display a randomized quote taken either from kanye.rest API from the famous quote API. The end user will have to answer the question using a button if they think the quote is from Kayne West or a some other famous person.
    
### API's Used: 
    
   Kayne.rest API: https://kanye.rest/
   Famous Quotes API: https://type.fit/api/quotes

}

 ```

### Wireframes:

### MVP:
    - Display a random quote to the end user
    - User must read the quote and determine if it is a quote from Kayne West or another famous person
    - If the user answer correctly he will be displayed another quote
    - If the user answers incorrectly, he will be displayed the correct author and will be displayed another quote to try again
    
### Post-MVP: 
    
    - Adding a link to the Wikipedia page of the famous person if the person if the Quote is not Kanyes.
    
### Goals:
    
    I first plan on building on rough website. Second I will fetch the API data and manipulate the DOM accordingly.
